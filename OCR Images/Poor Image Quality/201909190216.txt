your drainage system, as well as for some components that you may not have. Let the County
know if there are any components that are missing from these pages. Ignore the requirements
that do not apply to your system. You should pian to complete a checklist for all system
components on the following schedule:

(1) Monthly from November through April.
(2) Once in late summer (preferable September)
(8) After any major storm (use 1-inch in 24 hours as a guideline), items marked "S" only.

inspection. Add comments on problems found and actions taken. Keep these “checked” sheets
in your files, as they will be used to write your annual report (due in May, for Pierce County
Only). Some items do not need to be looked at every time an inspection is done. Use the
suggested frequency at the left of each item as a guideline for your inspection.

A7.14 Maintenance of Stormwater Drainage and Treatment
Facilities

Description of Pollutant Sources: Facilities include roadside catch
basins on arterials and within residential areas, conveyance systems,
detention facilities such as ponds and vaults, oil and water separators,
biofilters, settling basins, infiltration systems, and all other types of
stormwater treatment systems presented in Volume V. Roadside catch
basins can remove from 5 to 15 percent of the pollutants present in
stormwater. When catch basins are about 60 percent full of sediment, they
cease removing sediments. Oil and grease, hydrocarbons, debris, heavy
metals, sediments, and contaminated water are found in catch basins, oil
and water separators, settling basins, etc.

Pollutant Control Approach: Provide maintenance and cleaning of
debris, sediments, and oil from stormwater collection, conveyance, and
treatment systems to obtain proper operation.

Required BMPs

Maintain stormwater treatment facilities according to the O&M
procedures presented in Volume I, Appendix I-B, in addition to the
following BMPs:

° Inspect and clean treatment BMPs, conveyance systems, and catch
basins (Figure 4.23) as needed, and determine whether
improvements in O&M are needed.

° Promptly repair any deterioration threatening the structural
integrity of the facilities. These include replacement of clean-out
gates, catch basin lids, and rock in emergency spillways.

e Ensure that storm sewer capacities are not exceeded and that heavy
sediment discharges to the sanitary sewer system are prevented.

° Regularly remove debris and sludge from BMPs used for peak-rate
control, treatment, etc. and truck to a local or state government
approved disposal site.

e Clean catch basins in accordance with the information provided in
Volume I, Appendix I-B. Additional information is also included
in Chapter 5 of this volume, BMP 8.9 Cleaning Catch Basins.

° Clean woody debris in a catch basin as frequently as needed to
ensure proper operation of the catch basin.

e Post warning signs; “Dump No Waste - Drains to Groundwater,”
“Streams,” “Lakes,” or emboss on or adjacent to all storm drain
inlets where practical (Figure 4.24).
